# Federated-Learning-In-Wireless-Sensor-Networks
All of the Python stuff done on Pytorch 1.6.0, TorchVision 0.7.0 and PySyft 0.2.9.

In this repository, python codes that cover various aspects of FL are present. 

FedAvg is the most basic FL algorithm. The code form the same is present in the Federated Learning Algos folder.
A basic wireless setting for FL has been simulated in the FedAvg_Wireless_two_way_noise.py file present in Wireless x Federated folder.
Our main algorithm, that involves clustering clients on the basis of SNR, has been simulated in K_Ratio_CLustering.py file in Clustering folder.
